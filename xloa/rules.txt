	Rules for LOA (Lines of Action) - in Questions and Answers.
	===================================================

	Q:	What do I need for playing LOA?
	A:	LOA is played on an 8x8 checkerboard. Each of the two players has
		12 identical stones. One player plays with the white, the other with
		the black stone.

	Q:	What's the initial position?
	A:	Here is the setup for the standard version of the game:

	Q:	And what's the object of the game?
	A:	To bring all your stones into one connected group. Connected
		basically means that you can go from each of your stones to
		every other without having to jump over an empty field or a
		field occupied by one of your opponents stones. See also the
		example below.

	Q:	Who begins?
	A:	The player with the black stones.

	Q:	And then, in turn, each player moves a stones?
	A:	Yes.

	Q:	In which directions may I move?
	A:	You may move your stones either vertically, horizontally or along
		a diagonal, just as you move your queen in a game of chess.

	Q:	How far I am allowed to move a stone?
	A:	You must move exactly as many squares as there are stones on the
		line of movement. All stones count, yours and your opponents. E.g.,
		if you want to move to the right, you have to count all stones on
		that horizontal line. Then you know how far you must move.

	Q:	Could you show me an example?
	A:	Yes, but just a bit later :-)

	Q:	May I jump over my own stones?
	A:	Yes.

	Q:	May I jump over my opponents stones?
	A:	No, but if you land on a stone that belongs to your opponent, this
		stone is captured and removed from the board for the rest of the
		game.

	Q:	May I land on one of my own stones?
	A:	No, you can only land on free positions or on a stone belonging to
		your opponent, thereby capturing it.

	Q:	Now, what about the example?
	A:	Ok, here it is:

		Look at the black stone at c7, the one nearest to the upper left
		hand corner. You can move this stone one square along both
		diagonals because there are no other stones on these lines.
		You can't move the stone to the left because on the horizontal
		line there are three stones (your own and the two white ones)
		so you would have to move three fields which would mean that
		you would have to jump over the boarder of the board.
		You also can't move to the right because you're not allowed to
		jump over your opponents stones.
		But you can move four fields down and capture the white stone
		at c3. That's also the best move, because then all your stones
		are connected and you win the game :-)
	
	Q:	What happens if my move leads to a winning position for both me
		and my opponent (e.g. because I captured his last stone which
		was't connected to the rest)?
	A:	You made this move, you win!
	
	Q:	If I have only one stone left, is it a connected group and
		therefore a winning position?
	A:	Yes!
