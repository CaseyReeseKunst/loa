	Using xloa
	=========

	Basics

	xloa is not more than a graphical front end to another program, called
	loa. So, if you don't like xloa you always can use loa directly instead.
	See the documentation for loa to learn how to do it (or how to write
	your own version of xloa :-)

	Using xloa is quite simple: To move one of your stones simply click
	onto the stone with the left mouse button and drag it to the field
	you want to move it to. After you release the mouse button it will
	stay on this field if the move you've done is legal. And when you
	win you will be told so.

	If you're still a bit uncertain about the rules of LOA or don't like to
	do all the stone-counting by yourself you can move the mouse onto
	one of your stones and press the right mouse button. xloa will show
	all the legal moves for this stone. Here is an example:

	After a click with the right mouse button onto your stone at d5 the
	blue arrows show all the fields to which you may move this stone. If
	you release the mouse button, the blue arrows will vanish.

	You can even ask the computer what he thinks is a reasonable move
	for your side. To get such a hint just click somewhere onto the board
	with the middle mouse button. As long as you keep the button pressed
	a red arrow will be shown indicating the move as in this example:

# examp4.gif 50 5


	While in this example the hint is a really good move because it will
	win the game (but there is also a second, equally good one - do you
	see it?) you shouldn't take the computers hints as the Gospel: just
	following the hints will probably never make you a winner - loa is
	always thinking a bit farther ahead then it's going to tell you ;-)

	You also shouldn't be too astonished if sometimes you won't get a
	hint. Hints are a by-product of loas calculations for its own strategy,
	so at the very start of a game or after you have taken back a move it
	have to restart doing all its calculations and, unfortunately, can't
	give you any hints.

	After you have won the game you can start a new one by going to the
	'Game' menu and select the 'New Game' entry. Actually, beside the
	standard layout there's also a scrambled one and you can choose
	which type of game you now want to play. And if you hear your boss
	coming you always can select the 'Quit' entry and xloa will vanish,
	leaving no trace behind ;-)

	As you will find in the 'Game' menu you can also switch stones with
	loa if you prefer the computer to start the game. Now the profram will
	use the black stones and you get the white ones. Of course, switching
	stones can also be done after each move of the computer. If you want
	loa to play against itself you can use this feature by switching
	stones after each move.

	Of course, you can take back one or more moves you and loa have
	done so far. Either go to the 'Undo last move' entry in the 'Game'
	menu or simply press the backspace or the delete key.

	If you run out of time but want to continue the current game you can
	save it and reload it later by using the 'Save game' and 'Load game'
	entries in the 'Game' menu. You will be asked for a file name for
	saving or loading. While as a default an extension of '.loa' for file
	names is assumed you can choose any extension you like better
	(or none at all).

	By the way, you also can start xloa with the name of a file with a saved
	game as a command line argument. In this case xloa will automatically
	load the game and you can continue from the point where you saved
	the game.


	Changing loas behavior

	The 'Level' menu allows you to adjust how hard loa is going to try to
	beat you. With the 'Extremely Easy' setting even a beginner should have
	a real chance to win. The default level is 'Easy'. But take care: the
	harder loa is trying to fight you the longer you will have to wait for
	loa to make its next move! So, for the 'Insane' setting you will
	either need a lot of patience or a real fast computer (or both ;-).

	The second entry in the 'Level' menu has the following meaning: When
	loa has found several moves that it thinks are equally good it may either
	take always the first one it found (that's what happens if 'Randomize'
	is switched off) or pick one of them at random (if 'Randomize' switched
	on). So, if you want loa always to choose the same move in the same
	situation you will have to switch 'Randomize' off (the default is on).


	Options

	If you would like to have a list of all moves done so far go to the
	'Options' menu and select the "Show move list' entry. This will open
	a new window with a list of moves and a progress indicator. The progress
	indicator hasn't much more meaning than showing you that loa is really
	active while you wait for its move and give you a very rough estimate
	of how long you still have to wait. Don't expect it to be accurate !

	The next entry in the 'Options' menu, 'Edit board', lets you enter
	(or leave) the edit mode of the game. While, of course, you can use it
	to cheat (but you won't do this, will you?) it's there to allow you
	to create new layouts for the game to make it more interesting. When
	you enter edit mode a new area below the board opens up with at least
	a button labeled 'Delete' on the right side. If you click at it the cursor
	becomes a scull and if you now click onto stones they will vanish.
	To get out of delete mode click onto the button again.

	Beside this button there often are one or two more stones on the left
	side of the edit area, always a white and a black one. By dragging them
	onto the board you can create stones at new positions. But there is one
	restriction: If you already have 12 stones of one color located on the
	board the extra stone of this color in the edit area will disappear.
	Therefore, you can't place more than 12 stone of one color on the board.

	Finally, in edit mode you can pick up stones on the board and move
	them to different places without loa taking this for a real move.

	If you either drag a stones from the edit area or from the board to a
	field where there is already a stone, this stone will be deleted.

	If the next entry in the 'Options' menu, 'Highlight last move', is
	activated the starting field as well as the target field of the last
	move are highlighted. This will help you to keep track of loas moves.

	If you also want the stone that just has been moved to be flashed a few
	times when it is dropped you should activate the 'Flash moves' entry.

	Xloa can alert you by ringing the terminal bell when your opponent
	(i.e. loa) has finished its move. This is done by selecting the entry
	'Ring bell after moves' in the 'Options' menu.

	And finally, if you want xloa also to ring the bell on invalid moves
	activate the 'Ring bell on errors' entry in the 'Options menu.
