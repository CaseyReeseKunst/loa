loa knows the following commands:


help         - shows this list of commands
move from to - use this to make your move (e.g. move b1 b3)
quit	     - quit the game
play	     - let loa make its move
level [2-9]  - set the search depth to 2-6 (half)moves
show	     - shows the current board
showwhite    - prints a list with the positions of the white stones
showblack    - prints a list with the positions of the black stones
cc	     - exchange the colors between you and loa
from field   - 'from c1', shows all legal moves you can make with the
               stone on c1
takeback     - undo the last (half) move
who	     - prints the color of the player that has to make the next move
progess 0|1  - type 'progress 1' if you want to see the progress of loa's
               calculations
hint	     - show what loa assumes to be the best possible move for you
clearboard   - remove all stones from the board
setstone field color - 'setstone g4 black', places a black stone on field g4
               choose 'empty' as color to delete a stone.
layout 0|1   - 0 means the standard layout, 1 means 'scamled'


Beside these commands, there are some other commands which are used to
modify the behaviour of loa.
To understand the effect of those commands it might be usefull to know a little
bit more about how loa evaluates positions. 

To determine the value of a given position, loa calculates a simple sum like

weight1*value1 + weight2*value2 + ...

The 'values' are attributes of the positions like the number of groups, the
distances between those groups and so on. The 'weights' can be set by commands.

As an example, let's look at one of those attributes, the 'connections'.

Imagine a connected group of four stones. Beside some other possibilities,
these stones can form a straight line or a compact block (square). 
The straight line has the drawback, that it's possible to break up this 
group by capturing one of the stones in the middle of the line. 
If the stones form a compact block, it's impossible to break up this group.
So the latter will be preferred.
To find a value for the compactness of a group, 'loa' simply counts the number
of direct connections between the stones of a group. For the four stones on 
a line, this calculations gives a value of 3 while the compact block has the 
value 6.
Here is a little 'picture': The lines between the numbers (stones) are
the connections.

1-2-3-4

3-4

Setting 'connections' to a high value e.g. 9, forces loa to build compact 
groups.


setgw [0-9]	 - the distance between the different groups [2]
groupcount [0-9] - the number of different groups [9]
movelist 0|1	 - the number of possible move. Can only be used 
                   up to level 4 [0]
preview 0|1	 - difficult and not very useful - ignore it :-( [0]
connections [0-9]- explained above [2]
central [0-9]	 - stones on central postitions [5]
sumdist [0-9]	 - the distances between all the stones of one color [6]
stonecount [0-9] - the number of stones of one color [5]
