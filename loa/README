INSTALLATION:

In most cases 'loa' is distributed together with it's graphical 
interface 'xloa'. You should use the install script of the complete
package even if you want to install 'loa' without 'xloa'.
If you, for any reason, want to install loa without any
graphical interface, you should run the 'configure' script
of the package and then run 'make' in the directory with
the loa-sources.

After 'make', copy 'loa' to an appropriate place
on your system (e.g. /usr/local/bin or, if you are not root, your home
directory).

If, for any reason, 'make' fails to compile 'loa', you probably have to
edit the Makefile.

The rules of loa can be found in the file 'rules.txt' and a list of
commands known by 'loa' are in 'commands.txt'.

BUGS:

Loa can't handle situations, where one of the player can't move.
