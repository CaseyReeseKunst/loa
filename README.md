# loa
Lines of action (LoA) is a strategy board game, similar to checkers, othello and chess. Learning the rules of LoA takes only a few minutes, but, as you will see, the game is far from trivial.

loa uses seven evaluation functions. The weight given to each can be changed by the user.

See the file INSTALL for compilation and installation instructions.

loa and tkloa were written by Christian Weninger in C. The xloa interface was written by Jens Thoms TÃ¶rring.
