loa 1.0
=======

INSTALLATION:

Note: In order to use xloa you must have perl-Tk installed. Perl-Tk
is included in most Linux distributions but unfortunately it is
not always part of the standard installations. The 'configure' program
(see below) will tell you if perl-Tk is installed. If perl-Tk is not
found on your system, xloa will be installed, but you can't use it until
you also install perl-Tk.


1. Short version
----------------

In most cases the usual ./configure, make, make install should work.
As you probably know you have to become root for the last step. If
you can't become root, or want to make a local installation, you
can give a local directory to 'configure', e.g. by using

./configure --prefix=/home/john_doe/loa

In that case, you don't need to become root and the 'make install'
will install loa in the given directory, /home/john_doe/loa.


2. Long version
---------------

First of all, you have to unpack the archive 'loa-1.0.tar.gz' (you might
already have done this). If not just type:

tar xvfz loa-1.0.tar.gz

Some systems complain about an unknown option 'z'. In that case,
you need two commands:

unzip loa-1.0.tar.gz
tar xvf loa-1.0.tar

After that you should have a new subdirectory 'loa-1.0'. Now
change into that directory:

cd loa-1.0

If you have the possibility to become root on your system, type now

./configure

or, if you can't become root or want to do a local installation:

./configure --prefix=/home/john_doe/loa

where "/home/john_doe" is assumed to be your home-directory

You will see a lot of messages, where the last one (hopefully) tells you
that everything is ok.
Now type

make

Now you have to become root - except when you gave a prefix argument to
configure in the previous step. Type

su root

and enter your password.
The last step is:

make install

It is not necessary to continue working as root, so type

exit

Now you should be able to start playing. Type

xloa &
